            <p>The Sun is a giant sphere of plasma, primarily made of hydrogen and helium, and it’s in the main sequence stage of its life. Through nuclear fusion at its core, it releases vast amounts of energy, which powers the entire solar system. The Sun’s atmosphere consists of the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona, with solar flares and sunspots adding to its dynamic nature. Its solar winds, streams of charged particles, create auroras on planets with magnetic fields, like Earth.</p>

                <h1>Mercury</h1>

            <p> Mercury’s surface is covered with craters from meteoroid impacts, and it has cliffs, or “scarps,” formed as the planet cooled and contracted. Mercury has almost no atmosphere, only a thin exosphere of atoms blasted from its surface by solar wind. Because of its proximity to the Sun, it faces extreme temperatures ranging from 800°F (427°C) during the day to -330°F (-201°C) at night. It rotates very slowly, with one day on Mercury lasting 59 Earth days. Mercury takes about 88 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun, making it the shortest year in the solar system.</p>

                <h1>Venus</h1>

               <p>Venus rotates in the opposite direction of most planets, a phenomenon called retrograde rotation, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, resulting in surface temperatures around 900°F (475°C), hotter than Mercury. Venus’s surface features vast volcanic plains, mountains, and over 1,000 volcanoes. The dense atmosphere also creates an intense pressure on the surface, about 92 times that of Earth.Venus orbits the Sun in approximately 225 Earth days. Interestingly, a day on Venus (one rotation) is longer than its year—Venus rotates very slowly, taking 243 Earth days to complete one rotation.</p>

            <p> Earth’s unique features, such as plate tectonics, an atmosphere with balanced levels of nitrogen and oxygen, and abundant liquid water, make it ideal for sustaining life. Earth’s magnetic field, generated by its molten iron core, shields the planet from harmful cosmic rays. Its climate varies widely across continents, supporting diverse ecosystems, from deserts to rainforests. Earth’s Moon affects ocean tides and stabilizes its axial tilt, influencing seasonal cycles.Earth completes one orbit around the Sun in 365.25 days. This extra 0.25 day leads to an extra day being added every four years, creating a leap year.</p>

                <h1>Mars</h1>

             <P> Mars is a cold, dusty desert world with a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide. Its surface is dotted with large volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and deep valleys like Valles Marineris, which stretches over 2,500 miles (4,000 km). Mars has seasons similar to Earth’s but more extreme due to its thin atmosphere and elliptical orbit. Scientists are exploring evidence that water once flowed on its surface, raising questions about its potential to have hosted microbial life. Mars takes about 687 Earth days to orbit the Sun, which is nearly twice as long as a year on Earth.</P>

            <p>Jupiter’s powerful magnetic field is over 20,000 times stronger than Earth’s, and it has a vast magnetosphere that captures charged particles from the Sun, creating intense radiation belts. Its Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth that has lasted for centuries, and the planet’s fast rotation (about 10 hours) causes it to bulge at the equator. Jupiter’s diverse moons, including icy Europa and volcanic Io, are of particular interest for potential signs of subsurface oceans or geologic activity. Jupiter has an orbital period of about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days), making its year much longer than those of the inner planets.

            <p>Saturn’s rings, made up of countless particles of ice and rock, span over 175,000 miles (280,000 km) but are less than a kilometer thick. These rings are divided into several groups separated by gaps, with the most famous being the Cassini Division. Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, has lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane, making it one of the few places in the solar system with surface liquids. Saturn’s composition and fast rotation also create strong winds and atmospheric bands.Saturn completes an orbit around the Sun in approximately 29.5 Earth years (10,759 Earth days), which is over 10 times longer than a year on Earth.</p>

            <h1>Uranus</h1>

            <p> Uranus, an ice giant, has a blue-green color from methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. Unique for its extreme tilt, Uranus rotates on its side, likely due to a collision with an Earth-sized object long ago. This tilt leads to extreme seasonal changes, with each pole getting 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.Uranus takes about 84 Earth years to orbit the Sun (30,687 Earth days), meaning a single year on Uranus is almost an entire human lifetime.</p>

<p> Neptune’s atmosphere is turbulent, with some of the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching up to 1,500 mph (2,400 km/h). It has a series of rings made of dark particles, likely from shattered moons or other debris. Neptune’s largest moon, Triton, has geysers that erupt nitrogen gas, indicating possible subsurface heating. Triton’s unusual retrograde orbit suggests it may have been captured from the Kuiper Belt.Neptune, the farthest major planet from the Sun, takes around 165 Earth years (60,190 Earth days) to complete one orbit. It has only completed one orbit since its discovery in 1846.</p>

            <p>Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet, lying in the Kuiper Belt—a region filled with icy, rocky bodies beyond Neptune. Pluto has a thin atmosphere that expands when it is closer to the Sun and freezes when it moves farther away. It has five known moons, with Charon, the largest, almost half its size, creating a unique dual-planet system as they orbit closely around each other.Pluto, as a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, takes about 248 Earth years to orbit the Sun. This slow orbit means it hasn't even completed a full orbit since it was discovered in 1930.</p>
